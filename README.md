# 🧠 Sales Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to forecast **car purchase amounts** based on customer demographics and financial data. It provides insights that businesses can use to tailor their marketing strategies and optimize sales.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing: missing value handling, feature scaling
- Machine learning model: Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation: RMSE and R² metrics
- Streamlit dashboard for live predictions
- Visualizations and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- Features: Age, Gender, Salary, Credit Card Debt, Net Worth
- Target: Car Purchase Amount
- Total Records: 500

---

## 📈 Model Performance
After training, the model is evaluated using:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

---

## 📊 EDA Notebook (Coming Soon)
Notebook: `notebooks/sales_eda.ipynb`
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature distributions
- Outlier detection
- Sales trends and demographics

---

## 🧹 Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Model explainability with SHAP
